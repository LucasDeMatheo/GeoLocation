# GeoLocation
>  
>Have you ever thought about being able to get the geographic position of the regions/addresses of your data?  
>Being able to plot graphs with geotagging?  
>
>Using a geolocation API and a bit of code, this is possible.  
>In this example I used the geopy.geocoders API (https://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)  
>Version 3.0, available, is the third optimization I made to this code.   
>It allows faster searches by mapping addresses and creating a dictionary with them, allowing for optimized searches.
